## INDRODUCTION


REACT JS : React provides state-of-the-art functionality and is an excellent choice for developers looking for an easy-to-use and highly productive JavaScript framework. Using React, you can build complex UI interactions that communicate with the server in record time with JavaScript-driven pages.

JSX : JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React

Tailwind CSS : Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides us with single-purpose utility classes which are opinionated for the most part, and which help us design our web pages. Making It easier for us to stylize our web pages .

Github: GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere

## PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :

React provides state-of-the-art functionality and is an excellent choice for developers looking for an easy-to-use and highly productive JavaScript framework. Using React, you can build complex UI interactions that communicate with the server in record time with JavaScript-driven pages. Being simple to read and easy to use made React easy to understand and implement.React, when applied correctly, can save tremendous time, effort, and cost in frontend development.
We used utility of react to make a quiz app using react and tailwind js. There was the challenge of building logic and implementing hooks like useEffect and useContext but in the end we did complete successfully and pushed it into github and deployed with Vercel with continuous deployment

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
